# GifLash

A browser based game that allows users to register, host, join lobbies, and chat. The game has a similar concept to Quiplash or Cards Against Humanity. 

### Game Rules

Once all users have entered the game lobby the game session will begin. A random question will be generated and all players will enter the searching phase,
during the searching phase players will be able to search, and select a gif. After the timer hits zero, the game will move to the voting phase where all
players will vote on the funniest gif related to the prompt. The final phase is the outcome which will display the winner of the round. After all rounds
are complete a final winner of the game will display and players will be redirected to the main lobby.
